### **Live Demo**: https://mern-crash-course-y7ii.onrender.com/

A full-stack MERN application demonstrating CRUD operations on product listings.

This project was developed following the FreeCodeCamp MERN stack tutorial, with minor modifications in the frontend:
- Redux instead of Zustand for state management
- TypeScript instead of JavaScript
- Shadcn/ui instead of ChakraUI for the component library
- Added a populate-with-dummy-products button
